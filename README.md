# Buzzword Tracker

A light-hearted web app for tracking corporate buzzwords during meetings.

## What is this?

Ever find yourself in meetings where phrases like “synergy,” “low-hanging fruit,” or “circle back” are dropped more than actual value? This is a tongue-in-cheek web app that lets you:

- Add a list of buzzwords before a meeting.
- Click each buzzword whenever it’s mentioned.
- See a final tally at the end of the meeting.

Simple. Funny. Surprisingly satisfying.
